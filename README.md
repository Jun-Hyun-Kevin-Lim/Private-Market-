# Private Markets Retailization Platform (Proposal)

## Overview
This project proposes a retail-access private markets platform designed with “protection-by-design” guardrails. The goal is to expand access while managing liquidity, suitability, and disclosure risks through a semi-liquid structure and an auditable compliance workflow.

## Key Ideas
- Semi-liquid product design: redemption windows/caps, liquidity buffer, and structured risk controls
- Standardised disclosure: a one-page transparency label to communicate key terms and risks clearly
- AI-assisted compliance: RAG-based Risk & Compliance Brief generation with human review and audit logging

## Executive Summary
Private Markets Retailization Platform Proposal
This project proposes a retail-access private markets platform designed to expand investor participation while maintaining strong protection, transparency, and regulatory alignment. As private equity and private credit exposure increasingly moves beyond institutional investors, the central challenge is enabling access without exposing retail participants to excessive liquidity, complexity, or information risks.
The proposed solution adopts a semi-liquid product structure with built-in protection-by-design mechanisms, including redemption windows and caps, liquidity buffers, loss-absorption layers, and suitability controls. To reduce information asymmetry, the platform introduces a standardised one-page transparency label that clearly communicates fund structure, liquidity constraints, fees, and key risks in a consistent and comparable format.
To support scalable governance and compliance, the proposal integrates an AI-assisted compliance workflow. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combined with rule-based checks and human-in-the-loop review, the system automatically generates a sourced Risk & Compliance Brief for each product. All outputs are logged and auditable, enabling traceability, internal review, and regulatory oversight.
The project outlines a minimum viable architecture and identifies operational metrics for rollout, including disclosure completeness, risk coverage, and review efficiency. Overall, the proposal demonstrates how structured product design and AI-enabled workflows can enable responsible retail participation in private markets while preserving transparency, control, and investor protection.
